## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- **Perceivable**:
  - Alt text for all images
  - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
  - Content remains accessible when zoomed to 200%
  - Multiple ways to access content

- **Operable**:
  - All functionality available via keyboard
  - No content that flashes more than 3 times per second
  - Skip navigation links for screen readers
  - Clear page titles and headings

- **Understandable**:
  - Consistent navigation and identification
  - Error identification and suggestions
  - Labels and instructions for forms

- **Robust**:
  - Valid HTML that works with assistive technologies
  - ARIA landmarks and roles where appropriate
  - Focus management for single-page application

## Interaction Design Principles

### Feedback & Affordance

- **Visible System Status**: Always communicate the current state (loading, processing, success, error)
- **Clear Affordances**: Make interactive elements visually distinct
- **Response Times**: Acknowledge user input within 100ms, complete actions within 1000ms where possible
- **Microcopy**: Use clear, concise language for instructions and feedback

### Progressive Disclosure

- Present only essential information and controls initially
- Reveal additional options as needed based on user actions
- Use expandable sections for detailed information
- Implement step-by-step processes for complex tasks

### Mobile-First Approach

- Design core experiences for mobile devices first
- Enhance experiences for larger screens through progressive enhancement
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels
- Implement appropriate gestures for mobile interactions

## Performance Guidelines

### Loading States

- **Initial Page Load**: Skeleton screens instead of spinners
- **Action Feedback**: Button loading states
- **Optimistic UI**: Show expected UI state before server confirmation

### Perceived Performance

- Time to First Meaningful Paint < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive < 3.0s
- Layout shifts minimized (CLS < 0.1)
- Prefetch resources for likely user paths

## Testing & Validation Methods

### Usability Testing Protocol

- Task-based scenarios for core user flows
- Think-aloud sessions for qualitative feedback
- Success metrics: completion rate, time on task, error rate
- Satisfaction measures: SUS score, custom satisfaction questions

### A/B Testing Framework

- Primary conversion metrics: purchase rate, registration rate
- Secondary metrics: engagement time, repeat visits
- Minimum sample size calculations based on expected effect size
- Statistical significance threshold of p < 0.05

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Development Process

1. Design in Figma with component variants
2. Document props, states, and accessibility requirements
3. Implement in Shadcn UI with TypeScript
4. Review for accessibility and responsive behavior
5. Document usage examples in Storybook

### Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 640px
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px
- **Large Desktop**: > 1440px

### Animation Standards

- Use CSS transitions for simple state changes
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Respect reduced motion preferences
- Keep animations under 300ms for UI responses
- Ensure animations don't block user interaction

## Documentation & Updates

- Component library maintained in Storybook
- Design tokens documented in theme specification
- Regular audits for accessibility and performance
- Version control for design assets in Figma
- Changelog for significant UI/UX updates
