- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization
- Security patches and updates
- Testing infrastructure improvements

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebSocket synchronization issues | High | Medium | Implement fallback to SSE or polling |
| Stripe API changes | High | Low | Implement abstraction layer for payment processing |
| Cloudflare service disruptions | High | Low | Create fallback mechanisms for critical paths |
| Next.js version compatibility | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing before upgrading dependencies |
| Security vulnerabilities in file handling | High | Medium | Regular security audits and penetration testing |
| Database scalability issues | Medium | Medium | Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning |
| Real-time performance bottlenecks | High | Medium | Implement caching and optimization strategies early |

### Contingency Planning

- Maintain backup deployment options on alternative platforms
- Create disaster recovery procedures for data loss scenarios
